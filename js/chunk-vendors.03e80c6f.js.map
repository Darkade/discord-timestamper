It contains class and instance methods for creating, parsing, interrogating, transforming, and formatting them.\n *\n * A DateTime comprises of:\n * * A timestamp. Each DateTime instance refers to a specific millisecond of the Unix epoch.\n * * A time zone. Each instance is considered in the context of a specific zone (by default the local system's zone).\n * * Configuration properties that effect how output strings are formatted, such as `locale`, `numberingSystem`, and `outputCalendar`.\n *\n * Here is a brief overview of the most commonly used functionality it provides:\n *\n * * **Creation**: To create a DateTime from its components, use one of its factory class methods: {@link DateTime#local}, {@link DateTime#utc}, and (most flexibly) {@link DateTime#fromObject}. To create one from a standard string format, use {@link DateTime#fromISO}, {@link DateTime#fromHTTP}, and {@link DateTime#fromRFC2822}. To create one from a custom string format, use {@link DateTime#fromFormat}. To create one from a native JS date, use {@link DateTime#fromJSDate}.\n * * **Gregorian calendar and time**: To examine the Gregorian properties of a DateTime individually (i.e as opposed to collectively through {@link DateTime#toObject}), use the {@link DateTime#year}, {@link DateTime#month},\n * {@link DateTime#day}, {@link DateTime#hour}, {@link DateTime#minute}, {@link DateTime#second}, {@link DateTime#millisecond} accessors.\n * * **Week calendar**: For ISO week calendar attributes, see the {@link DateTime#weekYear}, {@link DateTime#weekNumber}, and {@link DateTime#weekday} accessors.\n * * **Configuration** See the {@link DateTime#locale} and {@link DateTime#numberingSystem} accessors.\n * * **Transformation**: To transform the DateTime into other DateTimes, use {@link DateTime#set}, {@link DateTime#reconfigure}, {@link DateTime#setZone}, {@link DateTime#setLocale}, {@link DateTime.plus}, {@link DateTime#minus}, {@link DateTime#endOf}, {@link DateTime#startOf}, {@link DateTime#toUTC}, and {@link DateTime#toLocal}.\n * * **Output**: To convert the DateTime to other representations, use the {@link DateTime#toRelative}, {@link DateTime#toRelativeCalendar}, {@link DateTime#toJSON}, {@link DateTime#toISO}, {@link DateTime#toHTTP}, {@link DateTime#toObject}, {@link DateTime#toRFC2822}, {@link DateTime#toString}, {@link DateTime#toLocaleString}, {@link DateTime#toFormat}, {@link DateTime#toMillis} and {@link DateTime#toJSDate}.\n *\n * There's plenty others documented below. In addition, for more information on subtler topics like internationalization, time zones, alternative calendars, validity, and so on, see the external documentation.\n */\n\n\nvar DateTime = /*#__PURE__*/function () {\n  /**\n   * @access private\n   */\n  function DateTime(config) {\n    var zone = config.zone || Settings.defaultZone;\n    var invalid = config.invalid || (Number.isNaN(config.ts) ? new Invalid(\"invalid input\") : null) || (!zone.isValid ? unsupportedZone(zone) : null);\n    /**\n     * @access private\n     */\n\n    this.ts = isUndefined(config.ts) ?
